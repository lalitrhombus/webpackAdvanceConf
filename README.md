# Webpack Advanced Configuration

Webpack is a complex tool and many times we go through the trouble of making a configuration which does all the necessary work under the hood for almost any web application and we almost always end up making a similar configuration (..well almost similar) all the time.

so this is a sample advanced configuration for the Webpack to start with which provide capabilities like

1. Linting for both JS and SCSS
2. Autoprefixing for CSS
3. Loading assets
4. Bundle Splitting
5. Code Splitting
6. Source Maps
7. Minifying
8. Tree shaking
9. performance optimization
10. Dynamic or Lazy Loading
11. Loaders
12. HMR for React

and some other concepts.

Although every project needs some tweaking in the config, though we can have a quick start just when we need it.
